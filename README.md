## Task
This assignment involved creating queries in SQL sytax to retrieve specific information
from the database "movies" (link provided below). Entering, modifying, or deleting data 
from an SQL database was covered in this assignment. This is my first exposure to SQL.

## Description
I used the SQLite database engine to accesss the database. To learn how to write effective
queries, I watched a video tutorial series on SQL from YouTube creator Socratica.

## Installation
A URL to download the database used was provided by Qwasar. SQLite can be accessed from the 
terminal by entering into the command line "sqlite3" followed by the database filename.

## Usage
Inside directory ex00, queries can be entered directly into the command line and the 
retreived data (if query is formatted correctly) will populate below the query. 


### The Core Team
I completed this assignment myself.
